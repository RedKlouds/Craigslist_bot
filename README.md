# Craigslist_bot

This bot is made to listen monitor traffic from craigslist and notify if it seems new listing, the problem i was trying to solve was how do i get the best deals, using a 'first come first serve' basis, thus I created this little python bot.

-> The way this bot works is for each specific interval it will check wethere there are any new entires that are different from the current exisiting recognized entries.
-> This bot also features random throttling of https request so we do not get blocked.
-> this bot also features notfication through an email and through text message.
